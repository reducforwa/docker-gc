## How to download and install firmware 4.2.28?
 
To update your Xtreamer Prodigy media player firmware, you will need a USB2 thumb drive that is known to work with your device. We recommend using one that is no bigger than 2GB and formatted to FAT-32 file system. You will also need to disconnect all external USB devices, such as Wi-Fi dongles, hubs, and HDD drives, and remove your internal HDD (if fitted). You will also need to disconnect the RF antenna from the internal DVB-T module (if fitted).
 
Here are the steps to follow:

1. Download the firmware file from [this link](https://drivers.softpedia.com/get/DVD-BluRay-Media-Players/Xtreamer/Xtreamer-Prodigy-Media-Player-Firmware-427.shtml). The file name is Emergency\_427.zip and it is about 200MB in size.
2. Extract the zip file using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You will get an install.img file.
3. Copy the install.img file to the root of your USB2 thumb drive (i.e., not inside a folder).
4. Insert the thumb drive into one of the rear USB ports of your Xtreamer Prodigy media player.
5. Disconnect the power from your device and wait for 30 seconds. Press and hold the power button on the front of your device and reconnect the power while still holding the button. After a few seconds, you should see the emergency upgrade process on your display device (if you have done everything correctly). You can release the power button now.
6. Wait for the installation process to finish. It may take several minutes, so please be patient and do not interrupt it.
7. After the installation is complete, your device should automatically perform a restore default, which will erase all your saved settings. However, it is highly recommended that you also manually perform a restore default by going to Setup > System > Restore Default and confirm with OK.

## How to verify that your firmware is updated?
 
To check that your firmware is updated to version 4.2.28, you can go to Setup > System > System Information and look at the Firmware Version field. It should display 4.2.28 as shown in the image below:
