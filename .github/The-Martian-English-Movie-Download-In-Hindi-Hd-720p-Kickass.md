If you are a fan of sci-fi movies, then you probably know some interesting facts and trivia about The Martian. But in case you don't, here are some surprising things that you may not know about this amazing movie:

- The Martian is based on a self-published novel by Andy Weir, a software engineer and science enthusiast. He did extensive research on Mars, space travel, and survival techniques to make his story as realistic and accurate as possible. He also posted his chapters online and received feedback from readers and experts, which he used to improve his novel.[^1^]
- The movie features a cameo appearance by Neil deGrasse Tyson, the famous astrophysicist and science communicator. He plays himself in a TV show called StarTalk, where he explains the orbital mechanics of the rescue mission to bring Watney back home.[^1^]
- The movie was filmed mostly in Budapest, Hungary, where a huge indoor set was built to recreate the interior of the Hab, the rover, and the Hermes spacecraft. The exterior scenes of Mars were filmed in Wadi Rum, Jordan, a desert valley that has been used for other movies set on Mars, such as Red Planet (2000) and The Last Days on Mars (2013). It was also used for some scenes in Lawrence of Arabia (1962).[^2^]
- The movie has a lot of humor and references to pop culture, especially to the 1970s disco music that Watney listens to on Mars. Some of the songs that are featured in the movie include "Hot Stuff" by Donna Summer, "Turn the Beat Around" by Vicki Sue Robinson, "Waterloo" by ABBA, and "I Will Survive" by Gloria Gaynor.[^1^]
- The movie shows Watney using a probe that landed on Mars in 1997 to communicate with NASA. This probe is based on the real Pathfinder mission, which carried a rover named Sojourner. It was the first successful rover to operate on another planet. The movie also shows Watney naming his rover Ares 3 after his mission, but in reality NASA names its rovers after winners of student essay contests. The current rovers on Mars are named Spirit, Opportunity, Curiosity, and Perseverance.[^3^]
- The movie was praised by many scientists and astronauts for its realism and accuracy. Some of them even said that it could inspire future generations to explore Mars and pursue careers in science and engineering. NASA also supported the movie by providing technical advice and sharing its images and data of Mars. The movie also coincided with some of NASA's achievements in space exploration, such as the Orion test flight and the New Horizons flyby of Pluto.[^2^]
